DESCRIPTION

Perl extension for rxvt-unicode (aka urxvt) to enable bidirectional
text display.


INSTALLATION

See the man page for urxvtperl(3) for a full discussion of Perl
extensions.  Enable this extension using one of the methods documented
there.  For example, you could place the script bidi in
/usr/local/lib/urxvt/perl, then add the following to .Xdefaults:

URxvt.perl-ext:           default,bidi
URxvt.bidi.enabled:	  1
URxvt.keysym.A-0x0062:    perl:bidi toggle show

This enables bidirectional text display, and maps Ctrl+B to toggle
it and show the resulting state.


SYNTAX

As you can see, the user command requires special arguments to indicate
the desired operation.  Any number of arguments can follow the perl:bidi
user command, and they will be executed in order.  They are:

on		Turn on bidirectional text display
off		Turn it off
toggle		Toggle it
show		Show a status message indicating the current state

REQUIREMENTS

This extension requires the Text::Bidi perl module
(http://search.cpan.org/~kamensky/Text-Bidi-0.03/lib/Text/Bidi.pm), as well
as the fribidi library on which it relies.  On FreeBSD, simply install the
converters/p5-Text-Bidi port.


OPERATION

If bidirectional text display is enabled, then whenever text is added to the
terminal window (the on_add_lines event), the text will be piped through the
Text::Bidi log2vis() function to reorder any RTL text found in the display.
This permanently changes the order of that text in urxvt, so any other urxvt
extensions which extract the text will see the text in the new order.

Because the transformation only occurs as text is added, changing the
bidirectional state does not affect text that has already been displayed.
You would need to redisplay that text to get it re-ordered.  For instance,
in vi/vim/mutt, etc., a Ctrl-L will do the job.


RESOURCES

The "URxvt.bidi.enabled" resource dictates the initial state of bidirectional
text display.  If 1, it is enabled.  If 0, it is disabled.
